# Spoofing
## STRIDE-SPOOF-1 - Spoofing of Cloud Admin
Securely manage Cloud and Kubernetes Credentials with following methods applied:
- Second pair of eyes are applied when executing privileged actions such as creating/deleting/updating a cluster
- Enable auditing on the management cluster as well as on the cloud provider
```
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
- level: Metadata
  resources:
  - group: "cluster.x-k8s.io"
    resources: ["clusters", "machines"]
  verbs: ["create", "delete", "update"]
```

# Tampering
## STRIDE-TAMPER-1 Tampering of Cluster API component binaries and configuration files
- During runtime: Alert on modification or restarts of cluster API components to detect for potential tampering.

## STRIDE-TAMPER-2 Tampering of Machine Images
- During runtime: Disable or restrict SSH access to prevent updates to machine image at runtime. Create alerting for sensitive file systems and when the machine is restarted.

# Repudiation
## STRIDE-REPUDIATE-01 Repudiation of actions performed by Cloud Admin
- Implement API server auditing for all clusters and Cloud API auditing to log all actions performed by Infra Admins. Additionally, implement centralized audit collection and alerting for any suspicious activity.
## STRIDE-REPUDIATE-02 Repudiation of actions performed using cloud credentials
- Recommended Mitigation: Implement Cloud API auditing to log all actions performed using cloud credentials granted to the management and workload clusterâ€™s control plane. Additionally, implement centralized audit collection and alerting for any suspicious activity.

# Information Disclosure
## STRIDE-INFODISCLOSE-1 Privilege escalation from workload cluster co-located with management cluster
- Strongly advise users to seperate workload clusters into different AWS accounts or Azure subscriptions.

## STRIDE-INFODISCLOSE-2 Exposure of kubeadm token credentials
- Disable or restrict SSH access to nodes in a cluster
- Audit KubeConfig files access, edits that are located on the node

## STRIDE-INFODISCLOSE-3 - Exposure of Management and Workload Cluster CA private keys and certs
- Disable or restrict SSH access to nodes in a cluster
- Audit access or edits to CA private keys and cert files located on the node

## STRIDE-INFODISCLOSE-4 - Exposure of Cloud credentials that allow privileged actions
- Disable or restrict SSH access to nodes in a cluster

# Denial of Service
## STRIDE-DOS-2 - Misuse of Infra Admin credentials to create unlimited number of clusters
- Apply second pair of eyes principle when performing privilege actions such as creating a cluster by an Infra admin
## STRIDE-DOS-3 - Misuse of Infra Admin credentials to create unlimited number of Nodes
- Apply second pair of eyes principle when performing privilege actions such as creating a node by an Infra admin
## STRIDE-DOS-5 - Deleting ELB instance for API server of workload cluster to disconnect management cluster from workload cluster(s)
- Alert on deletion of Elastic Lb so that it can be quickly restored
## STRIDE-DOS-6 Exhausting Cloud resources
- Apply second pair of eyes whenever possible for such activity
- Apply alerting on all cloud resource creation, update, deletion activities

# Elevation of Privilege
## STRIDE-EOP-1 Using workload cluster credentials to get access to mgmt. Cluster
- Separate workload cluster and management cluster at network level through VPC boundary
- Disable or limit node level SSH access
- Do not build a chain of trust for cluster CAs such that gaining access to workload cluster CA and private keys does not provide access to management cluster
- Limit who can create pod on control plane nodes.

## STRIDE-EOP-2 Using create pod permission to get cluster admin access to workload cluster

- Limit who can create pod on control plane nodes
- Disable or limit node level SSH access
## STRIDE-EOP-3 Use shared cloud credentials to get access to other unrelated cloud resources
- Create dedicated cloud credentials that have only the necessary permissions to manage lifecycle of a cluster
